## Description
Auto PR Writer is a GitHub Action designed to automatically generate pull request descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs). By default, it utilizes OpenAI's models, but it also supports integration with a variety of other LLM providers such as fireworks.ai, together.xyz, anyscale, octoai, etc., allowing users to select their preferred provider and LLMs to best suit their needs. This action can be customized with system and user-provided prompts to tailor the PR description generation.

```
This workflow triggers the action on pull request open, edit, and reopen events. Additionally, it activates the action on issue comment events in pull requests. It's important to note that it utilizes fireworks.ai as an LLM provider, specifically the highly capable open-source LLM accounts/fireworks/models/mixtral-8x7b-instruct. This specific LLM has generated PR text descriptions comparable to those of gpt-4.

## GitHub Action Inputs

#### `github_token`
**Required**
GITHUB_TOKEN or a repository-scoped Personal Access Token (PAT), defaulting to the GitHub token provided by the GitHub Actions runner. It is essential for invoking the GitHub API REST service to retrieve Pull Request details. Using GITHUB_TOKEN permits actions to access both public and private repositories, helping to bypass rate limits imposed by the GitHub API.

#### `openai_api_key`
**Required**
The OpenAI API key for authentication. Note that this key could be from other LLM providers as well.

#### `openai_base_url`
**Optional**
The base URL for the OpenAI API. Using this input one can use different LLM providers (e.g. fireworks.ai, together.xyz, anyscale, octoai etc.) Defaults to https://api.openai.com/v1

#### `pull_request_number`
**Optional**

System message/prompt to help the model generate the PR description.

#### `user_prompt`
**Optional**
Additional user prompt to help the model generate the PR description.

#### `event_name`
**Optional**
The name of the GitHub event that triggered the workflow. Useful for the underlying Python script to determine whether the action is run on a pull request or an issue comment event. Defaults to github.event_name variable.

#### `bot_name`
**Optional**
The name of the bot so users can guide LLM generation with @bot_name from PR comments. Defaults to auto-pr-writer-bot

#### `attribution`
**Optional**
Attribution for the bot added in the footer of the PR description. Defaults to Generated by [Auto-PR-Writer](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/auto-pr-writer) To remove attribution, set this input to an empty string.

## Smoke Test for Docker Image

To confirm the correct operation of the Docker image, perform a smoke test locally using the following steps:

1. **Prepare Your OpenAI API Key**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is ready for use.

2. **Execute the Image**:
   Run the following command in your terminal, replacing `<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>` with your actual API key and `<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>` with your actual GitHub token:

   ```bash
   docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY> -e GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN> vblagoje/auto-pr-writer deepset-ai/haystack main test/benchmarks2.0
   ```

   Modify the parameters `deepset-ai/haystack main test/benchmarks2.0` according to the specific repository main and pr branches, relevant to your use case.

3. **Check the Output**: After execution, verify the output to ensure the image functions as expected.

This test will help you verify the basic functionality of the Docker image. Remember to adjust the command with the appropriate 
project, repository, and branches you wish to compare, and ensure the security of your OpenAI API key throughout this process.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1) Which LLM should I choose for PR text generation?

When choosing LLMs for generating PR text, it's essential to consider the model's capability to handle long contexts,
as it's required to process all the PR diffs. As of January 2024, we've tested models like mixtral-8x7b-instruct,
yi-34b-200k-capybara, and gpt-4 variants. Both mixtral-8x7b-instruct and gpt-4 have demonstrated consistent
excellence in producing PR descriptions. Therefore, we recommend either of these LLMs for consistent quality, but
also encourage experimentation to identify the most suitable option for your specific requirements.

### 2) How do I use custom prompts to guide LLM in generating PR text?

Custom prompts are a powerful way to guide the LLM in generating PR text according to your specific needs. To use them
directly on the GitHub website, mention `@auto-pr-writer-bot` followed by your instructions in the PR description or
comments. These instructions act as additional context or directives for the LLM, helping it understand how you want
the PR text to be structured or focused. For instance, if you want the PR description to be concise, you might
comment: `@auto-pr-writer-bot, please be brief and limit each section to one sentence`. Remember to replace
`@auto-pr-writer-bot` with the customized bot name if you've set one. This way, you can effectively communicate your
requirements to the LLM, resulting in more tailored and useful PR descriptions.

### 3) Can we customize the name of the bot?

Yes, you can customize the bot name. In your `action.yml` specify the `bot_name` input. The `bot_name` is typically
set to a recognizable contributor on your project, so users can get name completion when they start typing `@` in
comments. Customizing the bot name allows you to tailor the interaction to your project's or organization's branding
and user expectations.

### 4) Can we skip PR text generation altogether when opening a PR?

Absolutely, to skip PR text generation, simply include the word "skip" in a comment tagged to your bot. For example,
you can comment `@auto-pr-writer-bot skip` in the main PR description text area. This feature allows you to bypass the
automatic generation when you already have a specific description in mind or when it's not needed.

### 5) Can I experiment with other LLMs and LLM platforms?

Yes, the Auto PR Writer is designed to be flexible with various LLM providers such as fireworks.ai, together.xyz,
anyscale, octoai, etc. You can specify different LLMs and providers by setting the `openai_base_url` and
`generation_model` inputs in your workflow. This allows you to experiment with different language models and
platforms to find the one that best fits your needs and preferences for PR text generation.

### 6) How should I test a new LLM and system prompt effectively?

To effectively test a new LLM and system prompt, refer to the `Smoke Test for Docker Image` section of this document.
If necessary, start by adjusting the `system_prompt.txt` file to reflect your desired system prompt changes. If you have
changed any of the project files such as `system_prompt.txt` or `auto_pr_writer.py` rebuild the docker image to
incorporate these changes (e.g. `docker buildx build -t vblagoje/auto-pr-writer .`). Then, initiate a series of
approximately a dozen PR generations, specifying your repository, base branch, and head branch as parameters for the
Docker run command.

Ensure the following environment variables are set correctly in your Docker run command:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>`: This should be your OpenAI or other LLM provider's API key.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>`: Your GitHub token for accessing repository data and making changes.

Additionally, if you're using a specific LLM provider or model, set the corresponding environment variables
for `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `GENERATION_MODEL` as needed. These variables will allow you to direct the script to use
the correct API endpoints and models for PR text generation. Refer back to the `Smoke Test for Docker Image` section
for the detailed procedure and adapt the instructions to fit your specific setup and testing needs.

### 7) I'm concerned about the PR text generation costs, how can I minimize them?

Managing costs is a critical aspect of using LLMs for PR text generation. As of January 2024, depending on the size of
the PR diff, a typical cost per PR using gpt-4 model is approximately a few cents, whereas using the
mixtral-8x7b-instruct on fireworks.ai is less than a cent per PR. To precisely monitor and manage your costs,
especially if you are using platforms like OpenAI, you can set the `OPENAI_ORG_ID` environment variable to track costs
accurately. This will help you keep a close eye on your usage and optimize accordingly to minimize expenses. Keep in
mind that selecting the right model for your needs and monitoring the market for the best rates among various LLM
platforms are effective strategies to control costs.
